# Face_Recognition_Project

This is an Attendance System Project based on Facial Recognition using Deep Learning in Python. It detects faces using previously trained dataset and marks their attendance in a csv file alongwith the date and time at which they were first detected. It uses neural networks to detect the faces.

Softwares to be downloaded (All the softwares used here are open-source softwares):-
1. Visual Studio Installer to use c++ build tools for installing certain c++ libraries
2. CMake for installing dlib library without which we can't install the facial recognition python library

Libraries and modules used:-
1. dlib to detect facial landmarks
2. facial recognition python library
3. python setup.py
4. opencv to use camera 
5. numpy
6. os to read images
7. datetime to mark attendance
8. pil

Algorithm used:-
hog transformation
